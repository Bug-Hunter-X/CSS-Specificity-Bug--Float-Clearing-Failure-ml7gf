The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error that may not immediately be apparent:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}

.clear {
  clear: both;
}

/* This div unexpectedly doesn't clear the floats because of the specificity issue */
.wrapper > .clear {
  clear: both;
}
```

In this scenario, the `.clear` class is intended to clear floats within its parent `.wrapper`. However, a less specific selector also targets `.clear` globally.  When both the global `.clear` and the specific `.wrapper > .clear` are present, the global one is overridden because of specificity.  The wrapper's child `.clear` will not successfully clear the floats, thus causing unexpected layout behavior.
