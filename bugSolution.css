The solution involves adjusting the CSS to ensure that the intended selector has higher specificity and is therefore applied correctly:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}

/* Removing the global .clear selector */
/*.clear {
  clear: both;
}*/

/* The specificity is solved with a more specific selector to clear floats inside of the wrapper. */
.wrapper {
  overflow: auto;
}

```

Alternatively, instead of removing the global selector, you can give the specific selector higher specificity, by adding another parent element:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}

.clear {
  clear: both;
}

.wrapper > .container > .clear {
  clear: both;
}
```

By using more specific selectors, we ensure that the intended behavior occurs.  The choice depends on your overall layout structure. Using overflow: auto also works as a solution in many situations.
